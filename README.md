#MyBikeWay console application

This is my first C# console project.
Application contains inner database classes and classes with CRUD methods and GUI for location and direction control.
All user inputs are validated with special static validation class (without any try/catch).
Basic purpose of this project was to learn and excersize
- Basic C# syntax
- Working with classes (OOP principles)
- GIT commands
- LINQ queries
- Working on project with more coupled classes

Next steps:
- Update project to not violate the SOLID principles - ongoing
- Use dependency injection to instaciate low classes and make them less coupled - ongoing
- Learn unit tests - ongoing
